# Reality Development Kit (RDK) Fiducial Marker-Based AR Demo

This demo demonstrates how to use the Reality Development Kit (RDK) to create a fiducial marker-based augmented reality (AR) application. It showcases the integration of RDK with a fiducial marker detection library and provides a basic AR experience.

## Getting Started
